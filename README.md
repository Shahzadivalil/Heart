# Heart Disease
In this project we are checking a person is diseased or not

## Objective:
Do classification(Diseased or Not Diseased) on this data and choose the best model with highest accuracy.

## Description:
The goal of this project is to predict the binary output.Whether the patient has heart disease or not.Today, heart failure diseases affect more people worldwide than other autoimmune conditions.

It is well known that the libraries available in Python for data loading, management, and building models, such as Pandas, NumPy, and Scikit-Learn, help build robust data science applications. However, when dealing with medical data in data science, data privacy and protection are important parameters that cannot be ignored.With Python programming language, cybersecurity professionals can efficiently accomplish these aspects in healthcare projects. Beyond data science, Python is also widely used for decoding and sending packets, network scanning, accessing servers, analyzing web traffic, and port scanning.

 Best Machine learning approaches for Heart disease prediction are:
    1.Logistic Regression
    2.Random Forest
    3.Decision Tree
    4.K-Nearest Neighbours
    5.Support Vector Machine
    6.ADAboost classifier

By performing this 6 techniques we will choose the best model for predict Heart Disease.

### HEART DATA DICTIONARY:

age : age of persons
sex : gender of persons
cp : chest pain type (4 values)
trtbps : resting blood pressure
chol : serum cholestrol in mg/dl
fbs : fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dl
restecg : resting electrocardio results(values 0,1,2)
thalach : maximum heart rate achieved
exng : exercise induced angina
oldpeak : ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest
slp : the slope of the peak exercise ST segment
caa : number of major vessels(0-3) colored by flourosopy
thall : 0=normal, 1=fixed defect, 2 = reversable defect
output : Target column, 1 = Diseased, 0 = Not Diseased
